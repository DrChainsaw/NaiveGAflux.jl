Neural architecture search for [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) through a genetic algorithm.

A marketing person might describe it as "practical proxyless NAS using an unrestricted search space".

The more honest purpose is to serve as a pipe cleaner and example for [NaiveNASflux](https://github.com/DrChainsaw/NaiveNASflux.jl) which is doing most of the heavy lifting.

## Basic Usage

```julia
Pkg.add("https://github.com/DrChainsaw/NaiveGAflux.jl")
```

Rest is TBD.
